What's new in at-spi2-core 0.3.92:

* Do not start accessibility bus if at-spi-corba is enabled.

What's new in at-spi2-core 0.3.91:

* Enabled the accessibility bus, so apps should be accessible, for instance,
if an application becomes setuid root.

* Several build fixes.

* Default to --enable-relocate for now.

What's new in at-spi2-core 0.3.90:

* FDO#29427: Registering for mouse:abs now works.

* Add methods/signals to allow an application to track the events that are
being listened to to avoid unnecessarily emitting signals.

What's new in at-spi2-core 0.3.4:

* Added GetChildren to the spec.

What's new in at-spi2-core 0.3.3:

* Add return values to some functions that were missing them.

* Make DeviceEventListener notifiers reentrant so that an application can
query the desktop object while processing a device event.

* Fix for FDO#28300: fails to link with pedantic linkers.

* Fix crash if GetChildAtIndex is called with an invalid index.

What's new in at-spi2-core 0.3.2:

* Make sure that disconnecting applications send their root path in the
remove applications signal. This was causing applications to not be
removed from the desktop properly.

What's new in at-spi2-core 0.3.1:

* Set an application's Id when registering it.

* Disabled relocation by default.
