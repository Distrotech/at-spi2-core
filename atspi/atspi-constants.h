 !\mainpage AT-SPI Interfaces and Subinterfaces

  This is the main documentation page for the 
  Assistive Technology Service Provider Interface (AT-SPI). 
  
  \section apps Applications and Interface Components
  Namespace Accessibility includes service APIs implemented by
  participating applications and their user interface components:\n\n
  Accessibility::Accessible\n 
  Accessibility::Application\n
  Accessibility::Desktop\n
  Accessibility::Collecgtion\n
  Accessibility::Component\n
  Accessibility::Hypertext\n
  Accessibility::Image\n
  Accessibility::Selection\n
  Accessibility::Table\n
  Accessibility::Text\n
  Accessibility::EditableText\n
  Accessibility::Value
 
  \section types Enumerated Types
  Accessibility defines a number of key enumerated types, including:\n\n
  Accessibility::RelationType\n
  Accessibility::Role\n
  Accessibility::StateType\n
  Accessibility::Event\n
  Accessibility::EventDetails \n
 
  \section Registry
  Accessibility also includes Accessibility::Registry,
  which is the service used by assistive technologies and related
  AT-SPI clients to register interest in certain classes of events,
  enumerate the currently available desktop and application list,
  and to synthesize certain kinds of device events.
 
  \section listeners Event Listener Interfaces
  Accessibility::EventListener\n
  Accessibility::DeviceEventListener
 
  \section helpers Helper Interfaces
 
  The following interfaces may be implemented by assistive technologies 
  themselves, in order to export their services in a consistent manner or
  in order to interoperate with other applications or desktop services.\n
 
  Accessibility::LoginHelper : Implemented by adaptive technologies which 
  need to participate in user-authentication or login activities, and which
  therefore may need negotiation with authentication agents or processes.\n
 
  Accessibility::Selector [NEW]: Implemented by user agents or assistive 
  technologies which export lists of choices from which the end-user is 
  expected to make selections.  Useful for various types of remote
  activation or intercommunication between multiple ATs.

ComponentLayer, in combination with Component bounds information, can be used       to compute the visibility of all or part of a component.  This is important in       programmatic determination of region-of-interest for magnification, and in       &#168;flat screen review&#168; models of the screen, as well as for other uses.       Objects residing in two of the ComponentLayer categories support       further z-ordering information, with respect to their peers in the same layer:       namely, LAYER_WINDOW and LAYER_MDI.  Relative stacking order for other objects within       the same layer is not available; the recommended heuristic is &#168;first child paints first&#168;,        in other words, assume that the first siblings in the child list are subject to being       overpainted by later siblings if their bounds intersect.

 * @ATSPI_STATE_ENABLED: <![CDATA[     Indicates that this object is enabled, i.e. that it currently reflects some application state.        Objects that are "greyed out" may lack this state, and may lack the STATE_SENSITIVE if direct user       interaction cannot cause them to acquire STATE_ENABLED.  @see STATE_SENSITIVE.   ]]>

 * @ATSPI_STATE_ICONIFIED: <![CDATA[     Indicates this object is minimized and is represented only by an icon    ]]>
 * @ATSPI_STATE_MODAL: <![CDATA[     Indicates something must be done with this object before the user can       interact with an object in a different window.   ]]>
 * @ATSPI_STATE_MULTI_LINE: <![CDATA[     Indicates this (text) object can contain multiple lines of text    ]]>
 * @ATSPI_STATE_MULTISELECTABLE: <![CDATA[     Indicates this object allows more than one of its children to be       selected at the same time, or in the case of text objects,        that the object supports non-contiguous text selections.   ]]>
 * @ATSPI_STATE_OPAQUE: <![CDATA[     Indicates this object paints every pixel within its rectangular region.       It also indicates an alpha value of unity, if it supports alpha blending.    ]]>

 * @ATSPI_STATE_RESIZABLE: <![CDATA[     Indicates the size of this object's size is not fixed    ]]>
 * @ATSPI_STATE_SELECTABLE: <![CDATA[     Indicates this object is the child of an object that allows its       children to be selected and that this child is one of those children       that can be selected.   ]]>
 * @ATSPI_STATE_SELECTED: <![CDATA[     Indicates this object is the child of an object that allows its       children to be selected and that this child is one of those children       that has been selected.   ]]>
 * @ATSPI_STATE_SENSITIVE: <![CDATA[     Indicates this object is sensitive, e.g. to user interaction.        STATE_SENSITIVE usually accompanies STATE_ENABLED for user-actionable controls,       but may be found in the absence of STATE_ENABLED if the current visible state of the        control is "disconnected" from the application state.  In such cases, direct user interaction       can often result in the object gaining STATE_SENSITIVE, for instance if a user makes        an explicit selection using an object whose current state is ambiguous or undefined.       @see STATE_ENABLED, STATE_INDETERMINATE.    ]]>
 * @ATSPI_STATE_SHOWING: <![CDATA[     Indicates this object, the object's parent, the object's parent's       parent, and so on, are all 'shown' to the end-user, i.e.       subject to "exposure" if blocking or obscuring objects do not interpose       between this object and the top of the window stack.   ]]>
 * @ATSPI_STATE_SINGLE_LINE: <![CDATA[     Indicates this (text) object can contain only a single line of text    ]]>
 * @ATSPI_STATE_STALE: <![CDATA[     Indicates that the information returned for this object may no longer be       synchronized with the application state.  This can occur if the object has STATE_TRANSIENT,       and can also occur towards the end of the object peer's lifecycle.    ]]>
 * @ATSPI_STATE_TRANSIENT: <![CDATA[     Indicates this object is transient    ]]>
 * @ATSPI_STATE_VERTICAL: <![CDATA[     Indicates the orientation of this object is vertical; for example this state may appear on        such objects as scrollbars, text objects (with vertical text flow), separators, etc.   ]]>
 * @ATSPI_STATE_VISIBLE: <![CDATA[ 	  Indicates this object is visible, e.g. has been explicitly marked for exposure to the user. 	  STATE_VISIBLE is no guarantee that the object is actually unobscured on the screen, only       that it is 'potentially' visible, barring obstruction, being scrolled or clipped out of the        field of view, or having an ancestor container that has not yet made visible.       A widget is potentially onscreen if it has both STATE_VISIBLE and STATE_SHOWING.       The absence of STATE_VISIBLE and STATE_SHOWING is semantically equivalent to saying        that an object is 'hidden'.   ]]>
 * @ATSPI_STATE_MANAGES_DESCENDANTS: <![CDATA[     Indicates that "active-descendant-changed" event is sent when children       become 'active' (i.e. are selected or navigated to onscreen).  Used to       prevent need to enumerate all children in very large containers, like       tables.  The presence of STATE_MANAGES_DESCENDANTS is an indication to the client.       that the children should not, and need not, be enumerated by the client.       Objects implementing this state are expected to provide relevant state       notifications to listening clients, for instance notifications of visibility       changes and activation of their contained child objects, without the client        having previously requested references to those children.   ]]>
 * @ATSPI_STATE_INDETERMINATE: <![CDATA[     Indicates that a check box or other boolean indicator is in a state other than        checked or not checked.  This usually means that the boolean value reflected or        controlled by the object does not apply consistently to the entire current context.       For example, a checkbox for the "Bold" attribute of text may have STATE_INDETERMINATE       if the currently selected text contains a mixture of weight attributes.         In many cases interacting with a STATE_INDETERMINATE object will cause        the context's corresponding boolean attribute to be homogenized, whereupon the object       will lose STATE_INDETERMINATE and a corresponding state-changed event will be fired.   ]]>
 * @ATSPI_STATE_REQUIRED: <![CDATA[     Indicates that user interaction with this object is 'required' from the user,        for instance before completing the processing of a form.   ]]>
 * @ATSPI_STATE_TRUNCATED: <![CDATA[ 	  Indicates that an object's onscreen content is truncated, e.g. a text value in a spreadsheet cell.    ]]>
 * @ATSPI_STATE_ANIMATED: <![CDATA[     Indicates this object's visual representation is dynamic, not static.       This state may be applied to an object during an animated 'effect' and        be removed from the object once its visual representation becomes static.     some applications, notably content viewers, may not be able to detect       all kinds of animated content.  Therefore the absence of this state should not       be taken as definitive evidence that the object's visual representation is       static; this state is advisory.   ]]>
 * @ATSPI_STATE_INVALID_ENTRY: <![CDATA[     This object has indicated an error condition due to failure of input       validation.  For instance, a form control may acquire this state in response       to invalid or malformed user input.     ]]>
 * @ATSPI_STATE_SUPPORTS_AUTOCOMPLETION: <![CDATA[     This state indicates that the object in question implements some form of &#168;typeahead&#168; or        pre-selection behavior whereby entering the first character of one or more sub-elements       causes those elements to scroll into view or become selected.  Subsequent character input       may narrow the selection further as long as one or more sub-elements match the string.       This state is normally only useful and encountered on objects that implement Selection.       In some cases the typeahead behavior may result in full or partial &#168;completion&#168; of        the data in the input field, in which case these input events may trigger text-changed       events from the source.     ]]>
 * @ATSPI_STATE_SELECTABLE_TEXT: <![CDATA[     This state indicates that the object in question supports text selection.        It should only be exposed on objects which implement the Text interface,        in order to distinguish this state from STATE_SELECTABLE, which infers that       the object in question is a selectable child of an object which implements       Selection.  While similar, text selection and subelement selection are       distinct operations.     ]]>
 * @ATSPI_STATE_IS_DEFAULT: <![CDATA[     This state indicates that the object in question is the 'default' interaction object        in a dialog, i.e. the one that gets activated if the user presses "Enter" when the       dialog is initially posted.     ]]>
 * @ATSPI_STATE_VISITED: <![CDATA[     This state indicates that the object (typically a hyperlink)       has already been activated or invoked, with the result that some backing data       has been downloaded or rendered.     ]]>
 * @ATSPI_STATE_LAST_DEFINED: <![CDATA[     This value of the enumeration should not be used as a parameter, it indicates the number of       items in the StateType enumeration.   ]]>

ROLE_FORM should not, in general, be used for toplevel GUI containers       or dialogs, but should be reserved for 'GUI' containers which occur within       document content, for instance within Web documents, presentations, or        text documents.  Unlike other GUI containers and dialogs which occur inside       application instances, ROLE_FORM containers' components are associated with       the current document, rather than the current foreground application or       viewer instance.     ]]>
 * @ATSPI_ROLE_LINK: <![CDATA[     The object is a hypertext anchor, i.e. a "link" in a       hypertext document.  Such objects are distinct from 'inline'       content which may also use the Hypertext/Hyperlink interfaces       to indicate the range/location within a text object where       an inline or embedded object lies.     ]]>
 * @ATSPI_ROLE_INPUT_METHOD_WINDOW: <![CDATA[     The object is a window or similar viewport which is used       to allow composition or input of a 'complex character',       in other words it is an "input method window."     ]]>
 * @ATSPI_ROLE_LAST_DEFINED: <![CDATA[     Not a valid role, used for finding end of enumeration.    ]]>
 *
 * Bitfield/set of flags generated from the AT-SPI specification.
