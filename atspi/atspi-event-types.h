 *@SPI_KEYLISTENER_NOSYNC: Events may be delivered asynchronously,

 *@SPI_KEYLISTENER_SYNCHRONOUS: Events are delivered synchronously, before the 
 * currently focussed application sees them.  
 *@ATSPI_KEYLISTENER_CANCONSUME: Events may be consumed by the AT client.  Presumes and
 * requires #ATSPI_KEYLISTENER_SYNCHRONOUS, incompatible with #ATSPI_KEYLISTENER_NOSYNC.
 *@SPI_KEYLISTENER_ALL_WINDOWS: Events are received not from the application toolkit layer, but
 * from the device driver or windowing system subsystem; such notifications are 'global' in the 
 * sense that they are not broken or defeated by applications that participate poorly
 * in the accessibility APIs, or not at all; however because of the intrusive nature of
 * such snooping, it can have side-effects on certain older platforms.  If unconditional
 * event notifications, even when inaccessible or "broken" applications have focus, are not
 * required, it may be best to avoid this enum value/flag.
 *
 *Specified the tyupe of a key listener event.
 * Certain of the values above can and should be bitwise-'OR'ed
 * together, observing the compatibility limitations specified in the description of
 * each value.  For instance, #ATSPI_KEYLISTENER_ALL_WINDOWS | #ATSPI_KEYLISTENER_CANCONSUME is
 * a commonly used combination which gives the AT complete control over the delivery of matching
 * events.  However, such filters should be used sparingly as they may have a negative impact on 
 * system performance.
